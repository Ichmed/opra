                <p>
                    There are two roles: <em>Player</em> and <em>DM</em>.
                    A player has control over one <em>Character</em>.
                </p>
                <p>The DM describes environments and <em>Obstacles</em>, and controls all non-player Characters. An Obstacle can be anything that hinders the player's progress towards their goal: a puzzle, a blocked door, a bouncer, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    A Player has access to a set of cards (called <em>Features</em>) that can represent anything from an innate trait like "super strength" over equipment and training up to abstract concepts like "mafia connections". Players use their Features to overcome Obstacles or perform other Actions.
                </p>

            <h3>Actions</h3>
            <div class="text-block">
                <p>
                    To perform an Action a player draws one card from a shuffeled deck consisting of two types of cards: <em class="suc">Success</em> and <em class="fail">Failure</em>.
                    If a <em class="suc">Success</em> card is drawn the action succeeds and the obstacle is overcome, if a <em class="fail">Failure</em> is drawn the action fails. (All cards are then returned to their owners)
                </p>
                <p>
                    To create a deck, Players adds all their relevant Features as either <em class="suc">Success</em> or
                    <em class="fail">Failure</em> Cards. The DM may force a Player to add a Feature to the deck.
                    The DM adds a number of their own <em class="fail">Failure</em> Cards equal to the difficulty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Difficulty is determined based on the manner in which the Player wants to resolve a situation.
                    "I want to break open the door", "I look for a key", and "I try to convince the janitor to open the
                    door for me" may all have different Difficulties.
                    Actions with Difficulty 0 may still <em class="fail">fail</em> due to a <em
                        class="fail">failure</em> card added by a Player. Some Actions with Difficulty 0 may still be impossible without a certain Feature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The owner of the drawn card describes what events occur to perform the action, or why the action
                    failed, based on the card that was drawn.
                    Consequently only Features that could be used to resolve the situation and the DM's generic <em
                        class="fail">Failure</em> cards can be added to a deck.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a Character <em class="fail">fails</em> the DM may do any or all of the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Enable/Disable one of their features. A temporary Feature is removed instead of disabled
                    </li>
                    <li>Give them a relevant and mostly negative temporary Feature
                    </li>
                    <li>Prevent them and/or other Characters from attempting the same Action again
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                        When another character performs an action you may add one relevant Feature as a <em

                        describe what happens.

                        Each Character starts with the same amount of Features (the excact amount is up to the group to

                        After a Session each Player may turn one temporary Feature into a permanent Feature and/or remove
